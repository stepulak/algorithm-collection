# Algorithm collection

Written in C# using .NET library. This project is far from being complete (17th July 2018). 
Goal of this project is not to provide powerful, generic and fast library for everyday use, but a helpful library which you
might use in your own project, modify it or learn from it.
Motto of this library is "Hey, I like this part, I think I will take it and use it in my project" (of course under project's license).
I (the author) do this library just for fun and personal use.
